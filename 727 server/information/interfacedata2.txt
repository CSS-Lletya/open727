I can't believe I'm going to starve down here.<br><br>If you've found this, I hope you have better luck than me. I was carrying tools for the Death Guard when shadows attacked us. The team outside died while I got pulled in to the Temple and was teleported to this...place.<br><br>I've just about given up trying to understand the trees here. They reflect light, and I could rotate them when I first came here, but I just don't have the strength any more .<br><br>I hope this helps you: the cores not only reflect, but can be charged.

Five hundred years have passed since the rule of King Alvis,

saviour of Keldagrim, victim of his own inventions.

Founder of the Consortium, the gathering of mining companies

that were to serve the monarchy, eventually the monarchy came

to serve the Consortium.

By the time of his death, the monarchy was all but abolished.

By now, the Kings of Keldagrim are but a distant memory...

with only the statue of King Alvis to remind the people of the

old days.

Now that I have found a new home, it is time for me to start my research. It will probably take me years, decades, maybe even centuries... <br><br>The toll it will take does not matter. I will make a device that will bring Glouphrie to his knees.

A History of the Goblin Race



Goblin tradition holds that<br>their race was created by<br>a war-god in order to<br>fight a war against other<br>gods.

(They never name their<br>god, so whether it is the<br>same as any of the gods<br>worshipped by the other<br>races is unknown.)

The legends also speak<br>of goblins fighting<br>against goblins during<br>the wars, so it is likely<br>that gods other than<br>their creators used<br>them as footsoldiers.

Although goblins are still<br>warlike, it is probable<br>that in earlier ages<br>they were more<br>organised than they<br>are now,



especially if they were<br>under the direct<br>command of one or<br>more gods.

This is corroborated<br>by finds unearthed<br>at various<br>archaeological sites,<br>including the large<br>excavation east of<br>Varrock.

Armour and weapons<br>have been found,<br>obviously made to fit<br>goblins but far more<br>well-made than their<br>current equipment.



Almost every piece of<br>ancient goblin equipment<br>has one of a number<br>of symbols on it,<br>and by correlating these<br>symbols with the<br>sketchy records that<br>survive from the<br>Third Age it has been<br>possible to identify<br>twelve distinct goblin tribes<br>or regiments.

The separate identities of<br>the tribes have long<br>since dissolved and<br>no goblins remember the<br>symbols, although their<br>generals may still<br>recognize the ancient<br>tribal names.

In the following pages<br>I present a list of<br>the tribes and their<br>symbols.

To: Engineer Claus Mousetrap

This morning I received a complaint about your inability to repair the Camp Tyras catapult, arriving without the tools and materials required.  To avoid further delay, I'll repeat your instructions:

*The replacement wooden parts must be made from MAHOGANY planks and at least MITHRIL nails. <br>*You will need METAL PARTS, which have been ordered from Rolad, the dwarf scholar.<br>The pride of the King's Engineers is at stake, Claus.

SORT THIS MESS OUT!

Instructions for Beacon Ring



Use this ring when you are ready to summon me to your aid. It is a daunting task, yet you must battle the king to allow me to remove the spell from him. When the king is almost dead, use this ring and I will teleport to your aid. Be warned - Though I am skilled with magic, I am no fighter! Should you summon me too early I will have to teleport us out of danger! When our mission is completed, I will remove the summon ability from this ring, but you may keep it for protection.                                   Zaff

Trawler: How To Play



If the Trawler's nets break, you can use rope to repair them.



If the Trawler springs a leak, you can use swamp paste to fix the hole.



If the Trawler starts to fill with water, you can use bailing buckets to reduce the water level.

Water





The blue "Water" bar shows much water the Trawler has taken on. Watch out! If the bar completely fills up you will sink!

Activity





The green "Activity" bar shows much you have contributed to this Trawler trip. If the bar ever becomes empty, you will be removed from the Trawler. You can fill the bar up by performing the following actions:

Clockwork Toys - A Clockwork Mechanism, Chapter 1.0



Making a clockwork toy is very simple and a good place to start for new crafters. Simply create a clockwork mechanism on your Crafting table, then use it and a wood plank to make a toy soldier or a doll. Wind them up and watch them go!

Multi-rotation head for lifelike simulation

A well-hidden clockwork system



The clockwork mechanism.



It would be simple to alter the design by adding a piece of silk to the wooden frame and clockwork mechanism. You could make a suit that could be controlled from the inside.

Help - respect

There's no need to report anyone for using the term 'noob', it simply means 'new player'.<br><br>Seriously offensive language includes racism and chat of a sexual nature.<br><br>You don't need to report players for using abbreviations such as 'lmao', 'wtf', 'gtfo'.<br><br>You shouldn't report any chat that has been starred out (like this: ****), as the censor has prevented anything that may have been offensive from being seen.<br><br>Solicitation includes asking for a boyfriend or girlfriend in-game.<br><br>Disruptive behaviour includes flooding the chat window with lines of unnecessary chat, but only if you feel it's impairing your gameplay.<br><br>Beware of context when reporting players for real-life threats: they could be talking about in-game combat!



























Help - ignoring a player temporarily

Now that your report has been sent, you can choose whether or not to ignore the offender. This is a temporary measure, and will only last until you log out. To permanently ignore a player, make a note of their name and add them to your Ignore List once the 'Report Abuse' windows are closed.<br><br>You cannot ignore moderators or people on your Friends List.





















Giving out your contact information in-game can put the security of your account at risk. There are some unscrupulous people out there, so, to protect your account and your privacy, it makes sense not to give your details to anyone you don't know.<br><br>Contact information includes: full name, email addresses, instant messenger screen names, telephone numbers, your home/work address or age.<br><br>Promoting a non-Jagex website in the forums or in-game could get you banned, even if you post the URL for your clan's site. We understand this rule may cause some inconvenience, but we want it to be impossible for people to send players to scam sites.



















Help - security







Help - honour

An item scam is defined as cheating another player during a trade. We don't consider it a scam to ask for large amounts of gp for an item, but it is not in the spirit of the game to overprice an item. It is your responsibility to make sure that you are paying a good price.<br><br>Asking for someone's bank PIN or recovery answers is just as serious as asking for a password; giving out your bank PIN allows other players access to your bank space. Never tell another player your password, PIN number or any other account security details.<br><br>If you notice a bug, please report it to us straight away. If, after noticing a bug, you continue to exploit it, you are likely to have action taken against your account.<br><br>There are no cheats for any of our games. Anyone that approaches you in-game to offer you cheats should be reported under 'Encouraging rule-breaking'.<br><br>Don't encourage rule-breaking, such as encouraging someone to try real-world trading, scamming or exploiting bugs.<br><br>You should not swap your account with another player, or share your account with anyone else. Sharing your account makes it less secure, and is also unfair to other players.



























Here you can select the offence that you believe the player has committed.<br><br>Clicking one of the offence buttons will send recent chat to Player Support for investigation. You should act quickly to report the player, particularly in areas where there is a lot of chat, such as at the Grand Exchange.<br><br>If you have selected the wrong player, you can use the 'Change player' button to return to the chat list and choose again.<br><br>You can only report players who have spoken recently.<br><br>Once your report has been sent, you'll be asked if you want to temporarily add the offender to your Ignore List.

Watch out for rabbits wandering around the farmyard. They are hungry and will look for flags, as they often mean hidden food! If a rabbit eats the seed under a flag, you will not get any points for it and will lose the flag. 





You can improve your Hunter skill by finding ogleroots in the farmyard and feeding them to the rabbits. Ogleroots are magical vegetables and will cause the rabbit to disappear for a short amount of time.






END OF INTERFACE:684START OF INTERFACE:685    




























Farmer Blinkin's Vinesweeper Instructions

1. Speak to either Mrs. Winkin in the barn or Farmer Blinkin outside to buy some flags.

2. When you have some flags, head out into the farmyard area over any of the 4 stiles.

3. Use your spade to dig up any of the holes around the farmyard. This will uncover what was in that hole. The aim is to place your flags in holes where you believe seeds are planted.

4. If the hole has nothing in it, then it will uncover a radius of 2 holes in all directions

5. If you uncover a number from 1-8, this means that there are that many seeds planted in the 8 holes surrounding the one that you have dug up.

6. When you have a square that you are certain contains a seed, either right-click and select the 'Flag' option or use a flag on the hole.

7. When a farmer sees a flag, he will come over to check beneath it. He will collect the flag and give points out if there was a seed there. If you have successfully found a seed, you will be able to get the flag back for free from either Mrs. Winkin or Farmer Blinkin.

8. Rabbits roam the area and will attempt to eat seeds where flags are planted or where they have been dug up. Use the ogleroots that you find on them to make them disappear.

Mrs Winkin's World of Seeds


END OF INTERFACE:686START OF INTERFACE:687










Use a spade to dig in the farmer's field and try to work out where the seeds have been planted. Try not to dig up the seeds, as this will lose you points! Usually, when you dig a square, you will uncover a number, which shows how many seeds are in the holes next to it.

Plant your flags in holes where you think that seeds may be found. If you are correct, you will get lots of points, but if you are wrong, you will lose the flag. If you are close to other players, you might get some points if they find seeds, too!"

While you are in the area, you will be able to see your points total in the top-right corner of your screen. Your points are saved, so you can leave if you wish and return another time to pick up from where you left off.

You can trade your points in for prizes or Farming experience by speaking to Mrs. Winkin in the Winkin shop.

Farmers wander the area looking for seeds that have been dug up by mistake. They will also collect any flags you have placed, resetting the nearby area and giving you points if the flag is in the right place.

If you place a flag over a seed, you will be able to get the flag back from Mrs. Winkin or Farmer Blinkin. If you placed a flag wrongly, you will have to pay 500gp for a new one.

However nice your friend is in RuneScape, they are still a stranger to you in real life. We would suggest that you have fun and enjoy the player's company in-game, but leave it there. 

Incorrect.

Correct.

Be polite and say no, but if the other player is persistent you can use the report abuse button and ignore functions, which can both be found at the bottom of your game window.

END OF INTERFACE:695START OF INTERFACE:696










Question:

Player Safety Test



A player has started to ask you personal questions that make you feel uncomfortable. What should you do? 

Answer their questions

Do not answer any questions and report the player using the Report Abuse button at the bottom of the game screen.











































Correct.

If you are at all concerned about the behaviour of another player, make sure you report or ignore them.



Incorrect.

If another player makes you feel uncomfortable by asking lots of personal questions, you can report them using the Report Abuse button. You can also use the ignore function, which can be found at the bottom of your game window.

Question:

Player Safety Test



A player has just asked you for your personal details, including your phone number, home address and email address. What should you do?

Give them my personal details

Say "No" or ignore them

Say "No" and ask for their details instead



















































Correct.

Be polite and say no, but if the other player is persistent you can also use the report abuse button and ignore functions, which can both be found at the bottom of your game window. 



Incorrect.

Giving out personal information to another player is dangerous, as you can never be sure who you are talking to. It's best to keep your personal details to yourself.



Incorrect.

Asking for another player's personal details is against the RuneScape Rules of Conduct. Doing so would put your account at risk of being banned.

Question:

Player Safety Test



How do you report a player for breaking the RuneScape Rules of Conduct?

By using the Report Abuse button at the bottom of my gaming screen

I should send an email to Customer Support.

I should find a Moderator and get them to report the player.

























































Correct.

You can use the Report Abuse button at the bottom of the game screen. Make sure you only report players who break the rules.



Incorrect.

We can only deal with reports that are sent in using the 'Report Abuse' button. Reporting players who break the rules allows us to ensure that RuneScape remains a positive and enjoyable environment for everyone. To find out more about reporting rulebreakers in RuneScape, please read the Rules of Conduct and then see our guide on reporting abuse. This can be accessed by clicking on the link: 'Customer Support' on our homepage and then 'Reporting Abuse'. 



Incorrect.

By waiting to find a Moderator, you run the risk of losing the ability to report the player.

Nothing. I can't report anything that is said in private chat.

Send the player an offensive message back.

Use the Report Abuse button to report the player and then add them to my Ignore List

























































Correct.

You can use the Report Abuse button to report any chat that you find offensive, whether it is said in Public or Private chat. Adding a player to your Ignore List will prevent them from sending you any further messages.

You can use the Report Abuse button to report any chat that you find offensive, whether it is said in Public or Private chat.

Question:

Player Safety Test



You are approached in the game by a player named JagMod999. This player claims to be a member of Jagex and asks for your account details. What should you do?

Do not answer any questions and report the player using the Report Abuse button at the bottom of the game screen

Give them my details; they are a member of Jagex after all.











































Correct.

A real Jagex Moderator would never ask for a player's account details. You can always tell who an official moderator is as a gold crown will appear before anything they say in the chat window. You can report any player who claims to be a member of Jagex staff by using the Report Abuse button. You can also use the ignore button, which can be found at the bottom of your game window. 





Incorrect.

A real Jagex Moderator would never ask for any of your account details, so we would advise you to keep them to yourself. You can report any player who claims to be a Jagex Moderator by using the Report Abuse button.

Question:

Player Safety Test



How long should you play RuneScape for at any one time?

As long as I like.

I should take regular breaks in order to stay healthy.











































Correct.

It's very important to remain healthy by taking regular breaks and spending time doing other activities. 



Incorrect.

Spending too much time playing games can be harmful to your health. It's very important to take breaks, exercise and eat properly in order to stay healthy. While it's great to play RuneScape, it's also important to maintain a balanced lifestyle.

This evil gublinch asked a player where she went to college. The player was smart enough to not tell the gublinch and reported him instead.

Item/note withdrawal: Clicking this button toggles how you withdraw items from your bank. `Item' mode places the actual item in your inventory; `Note' mode places a `noted' version of that object in your inventory. A note is worth the exact same value as the item it depicts, but is not the item itself and cannot be used as such. Notes are typically used for trading in bulk, as noted items can be stacked even if the actual item cannot be.

Deposit carried items and worn items. One button empties all of the items from your inventory, while the other moves all of the items you are wearing into your bank, if there is space. Items that cannot be placed in your bank will stay where they are.    









Across the bottom of the bank there are some other features, which, from left to right, are: 

Swap/insert: Clicking this button toggles how items are rearranged in your bank. `Swap' mode means that the item you drag and the item it is dragged over will swap places in your bank. `Insert' mode allows you to place an item in a specific bank slot, shifting other items over to make room.

Search: Clicking this button will switch your bank to the main tab and open a search box. Type the name of the item you are looking for and it will narrow down your banked items as you type. (Note: don't worry, your other items aren't disappearing, they're just being removed from the current search and are still in your bank.) 





The Bank of RuneScape is a great place to keep all of your belongings safe. The bank has branches all over RuneScape, so you're never very far away from your possessions.

The tab furthest to the left is the main bank tab (pictured left). The main tab will always display the entire contents of your bank account, but you can also create up to eight other tabs in which to categorise your banked items.

To create a new tab, simply drag any item in your bank on to the `plus' tab (pictured right). You can then drag as many other items as you want on to this new tab. Clicking on a tab other than the main one will show you only those items you have placed within it. The icon used to mark each new tab is taken from the first item within that tab.











Using this tab system will allow you to easily group together related items as you wish. For instance, you could place all of your food in one tab, or all of your weapons in another. Alternatively, you could create a tab to contain all of those items you use to train a skill or play a certain activity. There is no limit to the number of times you can rearrange your bank, so feel free to experiment. 

Near the bottom-left corner of the bank you will see a set of four numbers, as shown to the left.



The first two numbers, separated by a diagonal line, represent your non-member bank space and how much of that bank space you have filled with non-member items. The second two numbers, separated by the other diagonal line, represent the bank space you have gained by being a member, and how much of that bank space you have filled with member items.

Select Complexity











The complexity of a dungeon determines how many of your skills and abilities will be tested in a raid. Choosing a lower complexity will make the dungeon more straight-forward to complete, but it will also lower the Dungeoneering XP reward you receive at the end.<br><br>When you first start Dungeoneering, only complexity 1 will be unlocked. You must complete at least one raid at that complexity before you can unlock the next.

The deeper you go down into Daemonheim, the more powerful the creatures become. As the difficulty increases with depth, so does the Dungeoneering XP reward you receive at the end of a raid.<br><br>When you first start Dungeoneering, only floor 1 will be unlocked. You must complete a raid of a floor before you can unlock the next one, and you may only access a floor if you have the necessary Dungeoneering skill level.<br><br>All members of your party must have the floor unlocked for you to raid it. To see which floors are unlocked by all players, look at the columns that run vertically down the screen to the left - there's a column for each member of your group.

Each task helps Pauline make produce. If you don't have the Magic skill level to cast the spell used in a task, you won't get any Magic XP and you'll only assist in making half the produce.

Safalaan Hallow,

I have desired to speak with you for so long. You may not know me, but I have been following you with great interest.

I shall get straight to the point, for there is little time. I knew your parents, Safalaan. I was very close to them and to you as a child, centuries ago when this land was free. 

I know you feel that you are different; that some part of your history is missing to you.

The numbers around the dance floor relate to the row or column they are lined up with, and tell you how many adjacent tiles within that row or column need to be turned on.<br><br>For instance, a row with 10 next to it would need all ten tiles in that row turned on; or a column with 4 next to it means four tiles need turning on in that column.

To begin sequencing a pattern, simply step out onto your dance floor and a series of numbers will become visible around its top and left edges.<br><br>These numbers tell you which dance floor tiles need to be turned on to create a pattern - in this case, a Halloween-themed image. To toggle tiles on or off, simply walk to one.











Dance Floor Pattern Sequencing

Page%1

Page%2

Example skull pattern.

Some rows and columns might have more than one number next to them, as in the example on the other page.<br><br>The space between the numbers indicates there will be some off tiles between the sets of on tiles - note the difference between the three rows with the numbers '1 2 1' next to them, and how they differ.

Also in the example image are the columns '6 3', which would have to be six tiles on, one tile off, three tiles on - because 6+1+3 = 10. Finding rows or columns that have only one possible answer first is a good way to start.<br><br>The more tiles that are correctly turned on, the more information you have to solve other rows and columns.
