/**
 * A sequence of {@link LinkedTask}s that are ran in <i>FIFO</i> order, and the
 * solution to scheduling tasks in bulk. The problem with scheduling many tasks
 * in succession is that math (a pain) or nesting tasks (very ugly) will have to
 * be used in order to time the delays properly. Another issue is having 10s,
 * 100s, and in some cases maybe even 1000s of tasks running at once for one
 * single context!
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Linked task sequences work by utilizing an internal queue to keep a record of
 * tasks, in the order they were added. They can be configured to {@code replay}
 * so that when the sequence finishes, it starts over again. When a sequence is
 * executed, it acts as a single task determining when links need to be executed
 * (and subsequently removed) which solves the issue of having too many tasks
 * running for a single context. The way that execution for links is done is in
 * succession, meaning this solves this issue of having to nest tasks or use
 * math to figure out the delays; For instance, take these examples:
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 * World.get().submit(new Task(5, false) {
 *     &#064;Override
 *     public void execute() {
 *         System.out.println(&quot;#1: executed after 5 ticks&quot;);
 *     }
 * });
 * World.get().submit(new Task(7, false) {
 *     &#064;Override
 *     public void execute() {
 *         System.out.println(&quot;#2: executed 2 ticks after #1&quot;);
 *     }
 * });
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Or instead of the math, the nesting tasks alternative.
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 * World.get().submit(new Task(5, false) {
 *     &#064;Override
 *     public void execute() {
 *         System.out.println(&quot;#1: executed after 5 ticks&quot;);
 *         World.get().submit(new Task(2, false) {
 *             &#064;Override
 *             public void execute() {
 *                 System.out.println(&quot;#2: executed 2 ticks after #1&quot;);
 *             }
 *         });
 *     }
 * })
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Both very ugly, and extremely verbose. Now the same thing with a linked task
 * sequence...
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 * LinkedTaskSequence queue = new LinkedTaskSequence();
 * queue.connect(5, () -&gt; System.out.println(&quot;#1: executed after 5 ticks&quot;));
 * queue.connect(2, () -&gt; System.out.println(&quot;#2: executed 2 ticks after #1&quot;));
 * queue.start();
 * </pre>
