# open727
An open source #727 Matrix-based base. I personaly found that the 718 caches out there asuaully broken in more than one way. #727 revision came out in 2012. Not too far off from 718 but had seen some more game upddates since.
[Check out the official build number list & their updates here](https://runescape.fandom.com/wiki/Build_number). Feel free to contribute & Share the love for development.

# Goals

# Client
The client provided is a standard 727 Client, not renamed by myself. There's a more renamed client as some of you may know that's already public. I highly recommend using that and contributing if you can.
